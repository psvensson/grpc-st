# grpc-st
The idea was to crfeate a Smalltalk implementation for gRPC (Ported from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/grpc-js)

NOTE!!!  This project does not work. It probably never will. It id dependent in HTTP 2.0 being implemented in Pharo Zinc web server and client. This is a bit of an undertaking, though doable, now that Pharo 9 uses OpenSSL > 1.02, and thus have TLS 1.3 which HTTP 2 needs. But until then this is a bit blocked.
